# Generative AI with LangChain Python

This repository is a comprehensive guide and hands-on implementation of **Generative AI projects using LangChain with Python**. It demonstrates the power of LangChain for building practical applications like **chatbots, RAG pipelines, search engines, and SQL assistants**.

The focus is to explore, implement, and showcase various **LangChain capabilities** such as:

* Data ingestion and transformations
* Text embeddings and vector databases
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
* Chatbot development and conversational memory
* SQL query automation
* Search and summarization pipelines

This repository is **practical and notebook-driven**, with continuous updates to add more real-world examples and modules.
